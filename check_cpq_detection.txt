Look for these console log messages:

1. "CPQ BOAT - Using CPQ base boat dealer cost: $..."
2. "CPQ BOAT - Added base boat to boatpackageprice: $..."
3. "CPQ BOAT - Added base boat to saleboatpackageprice: $..."

If you DON'T see these messages, then isCpqBoat is false, which means:
   - Either isCpqAuthorized is false
   - Or window.cpqBaseBoatDealerCost is not set or is 0

Please also check:
- What is window.cpqBaseBoatDealerCost set to?
- What is window.cpqBaseBoatMSRP set to?
- What is isCpqAuthorized set to?

You can check these in the browser console by typing:
   window.cpqBaseBoatDealerCost
   window.cpqBaseBoatMSRP
   isCpqAuthorized
